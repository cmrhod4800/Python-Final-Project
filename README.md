# Python-Final-Project
This a repository for 3200K Python Programming of fall 2015 with professor Zac Miller containing code written to program the game "Scrabble".
I have created a scrabble game that has different functions. To do this I used the software made avalible to me through the University of North Georgia. To exicute this code in python specifically I used "Idle". Each funtion is defined to enable a player to manipulate the game. Each player or players will be goven seven random letters to generate a word just like the real game. I also found some code online that generated a players board, I will reference everything I have used in my final write up. 
However, to clarify the source in this repositoryhere is the link: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22111126/how-would-i-create-a-text-based-board-for-a-scrabble-game-in-python.
Most of the help I have recieved in editing this project was from my professor Zac Miller.
